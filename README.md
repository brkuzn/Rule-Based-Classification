This is a project created by VBO. A gaming company wants to create new level based customer definitions by using certain characteristics of its customers and form new segments accordingly. Then they aim to use these new segments in order to predict how much the company can earn from potential customers on average. 
Here I’m using persona.cv dataset. This dataset includes the pricing of a mobile application and its users’ age, nationality, gender. I’m re-observing these variables by creating new and more inclusive personas and segmenting them according to average spending. Thus, we can predict  how much profit we can make from different kinds of customers.
